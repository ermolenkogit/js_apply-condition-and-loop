# Apply conditions and loops

## The task

1) Automate questions to the user about movies with the help of a loop

2) Make it so that the user can't leave the answer as an empty string,
cancel the answer or enter a movie title longer than 50 characters. If this happens 
return the user to the questions again. (Any string can be referred to as 
str.length - and get its length)

3) Use conditions to check personalMovieDB.count, and if it is less than 10 - print the message
"Not many movies watched", if from 10 to 30 - "You're a classic viewer", and if more - 
"You're a movie buff." And if it does not fit any of the options - "There was an error"
